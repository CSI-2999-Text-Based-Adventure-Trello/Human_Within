When you reach the back end, you follow Hands to a door, where he kneels down, raises his hands, and wiggles his fingers. His right index finger extends to a fine point. He grins and picks the lock within only a few seconds. The door swings open and Argentum enters first.
“Alright, let’s sneak around the back then.” Hands leads the way around the building through the green foliage. There’s no sign of any androids about, nor can any noise be heard within.
