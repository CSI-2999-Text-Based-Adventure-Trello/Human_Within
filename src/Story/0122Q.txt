What will you do?
You leave the area, hoping to avoid any problems further and decided to run out the window with the necklace and never return here. A couple of hours later there were cyborg-police that stopped you, maybe because in this community everyone knows who's who and what kind of people live here. So they asked me questions regarding your identity and you responded "I am around here" and " I'm originally from New York", and most importantly asked for your ID, which basically was the memory chip because they can somehow trace your information and name but shockingly with no face ID. So you can basically use the memory chip as your ID and also told you that you have "$4,000,000" as a welcome bonus to the state of Florida. You decided to cap of the day with the money by?
