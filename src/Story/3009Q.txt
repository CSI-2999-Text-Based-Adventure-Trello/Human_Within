This was nothing at all like you were expecting when you were to wake up from cryofreeze. The androids in front of you are acting eerily similar to humans. You look to the android apparently named Argentum and he once again shapes his face into a grin.
“For starters, if you help us we can take you to an… acquaintance of ours, someone who specializes in humans and even grows human food. But first we need some new parts. There’s a facility on the other side of the mountain stocked with exactly what we need. It should be no trouble.” As the bluish android finishes speaking, the yellow android’s left arm falls to the card table with a metallic CLANG!
