The bluish android with sculpted hands lets out a short laugh. “Let’s just say you’re a long way from home. We’d about given up on you waking up, but Argentum here,” he motions toward the silver android, “he insisted on watching over you. I’m sure you have many questions, but look… We’re in very poor condition and won’t last much longer without some new parts. We were hoping you could lend us a hand… even if it's made of flesh.”
When you initially started to follow the silver android, Argentum, you hoped he was going to lead you to the medical team that would facilitate your awakening and help you get ready for your new life. Instead, the android led you to more androids who are asking YOU for help. You still have so many questions.
