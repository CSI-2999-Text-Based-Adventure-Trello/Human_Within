The androids inhabiting the building bring back sacks full of the parts they supposedly stole and Hands seems happy enough. The androids beg your forgiveness, which you give them, and you shortly leave back into the forest. After a few minutes of walking, Hands is the first to speak. “You were great back there. It might be simpler for you to just get on your way. I can carry the parts back to the cave and Argentum can lead you to our Astra friend.”
Your stomach growls loudly as you think of the food their Astra friend supposedly has. “Alright, then you and Argentum can start heading toward the city. Thanks for your help, human. I feel this won’t be our last meeting,” Hands grins and starts off again. You and Argentum look at one another and he shrugs. He begins leading you to the city.
