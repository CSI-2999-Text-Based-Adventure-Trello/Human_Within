What will you do?
You decide that the last thing you want to do is go deeper into this mess. Plus, you didn't really feel like walking up the stairs would be fun later. You enter the elevator, press the ground for button, it lurches, and then starts ascending.The elevator reaches the top and comes to a jerky stop. Almost exactly as you step off the elevator you hear a snap in the screeching of metal. You don't even bother to look back you know that the elevator is gone. There's no turning back now.Everything is overgrown on the surface, but there appears to be two paths. One seems to be leading towards an industrial complex, and the other seems to be a winding path that heads off into the distance.
