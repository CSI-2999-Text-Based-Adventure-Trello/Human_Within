The Cartographer extends his palms toward you. “Humankind physically has perished, this much is true. But so much of your history and ideas still live on today! While androids initially rejected a majority of human ideals and culture, inevitably over time we adopted much of it. Many androids alter their appearances to seem more human-like with defining features, many install Emotional Microchips to emulate human feelings… Our government systems resemble yours, our communities…” The Cartographer seems joyful to be talking about humanity and its effects on the world. 
Your head is still swimming and you feel slightly sick. You’re the last human.
