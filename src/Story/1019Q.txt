After wandering around for a while you come upon a massive structure made of mostly glass. You stop and behold its beauty, but then realize that it's the first building you’ve seen that has windows.You head to the main entrance and enter the building. As you enter you see another android, an info board, and the main entrance to the conservatory. What do you do?
Your stomach starts to feel heavy. You decide that it might be a good idea to head to the botanical gardens and try and get some food. You’re still very confused as to why there is a lack of basic amenities, but you are too hungry to ponder the weird changes in society after several hundred years. You walk outside and notice that the sun looks and feels different from what you remember. You look up, and realize that what you thought was the sky actually seems to be some massive structure. It seems to go on forever… You make your way through the town trying your best to understand the directions that were given to you. You have trouble deciphering the new language that seems to have been adopted over the last few centuries.
