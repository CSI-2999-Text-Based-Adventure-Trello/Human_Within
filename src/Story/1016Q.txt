Does that help?
Do you have a broken neural link? We have a high-speed data connection here and you have free access to it with the room you bought. ---You answer back saying your neural link is indeed broken.--- Well, if you're looking to get your neural link fixed you can go down to Crade's. He can fix it for you for a reasonable price, or install a new one fairly quickly. If you don't have time for that today, there's an old information hub on the other side of the city. It's currently housed in what was an ancient library. There will be some physical computers that you can interface with.
