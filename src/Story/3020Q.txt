The first android that spoke speaks again. “We should not have committed crimes. We are not bad androids, simply desperate. Please, how can we settle this?” Hands explains what parts were stolen, and the android sends another away to go collect them.
One android drops their rifle. “This… emotion! I have heard of this human! They are from the Age of Man and have come forward in time to enact their human vengeance on androids!” The android falls to its knees. “I am sorry, Creator, for what we have done!” You stare in slight shock as the rest of the androids begin to kneel as well. You look to Hands and one of his eyes momentarily goes dark, in a wink.
