What do you do?
You decide that after the day you've had, it would be best to find someplace to sleep that isn't cold and metallic. Shortly after exploring the town more you come upon an Inn; charmingly named "The Plug and Socket". When you walk inside you scan the room. It's very late at night so not many people are around. You see that there's a barkeep. Upon closer inspection you realize it seems to have some sort of augmentation. Before you have time to do any further analysis, the barkeep notices you. The barkeep then starts to make what seem like incoherent noises to you. You think he's trying to communicate with you.
