The Cartographer grins at you. “That’s the spirit! Follow me downstairs to my lab, it’ll take only a few minutes to set up the Conscience Transferral device.” You follow him downstairs and watch as he sets up two metal chairs, each fitted with a cap to go around the head, and in one chair a lifeless android body, icy blue in color. Your new body. It looks strong and is about the same height as you. When all is ready, you get into the chair and look at Argentum. He’s shifting weight from foot to foot, but gives you a thumbs up. 
You fit the metal cap to your head and tell the Cartographer you are ready. Some machines are powered on, some lights and noises whirr, and suddenly everything goes black. Your last thought before slipping into a permanent, peaceful sleep is wondering why the icy-blue android’s serial number written on its chest seems so familiar to you… IV-35… And your consciousness slips away one last time, leaving you eternally unaware that the operation was a success; your human brain and its capacities were transferred to the icy-blue android, though you were never meant to survive.
