As you step outside of the conservatory, the air you breathe feels a bit more rough than earlier, after hearing about the radiation. Perhaps a sort of breathing mask is in order. Maybe you should consider the reverse-cyborg operation. You consider asking Argentum, but he cannot reply. Maybe you can help him get his speech system fixed too. Who knows what this new, android world holds in store for you? You start to follow Argentum through the city toward the mountain-cave, and dawn has finally come, with the same sun that rose over 10,000 years ago.
The Cartographer is silent for a few moments. Then he spreads his hands, “Of course. Your life is your own, and I am getting far too ahead of myself. Perhaps in time you’ll change your mind. In the meantime, would you care for some fruit? I’m sure you’re starving. I grow all this food, but it’s not as if I can eat it.” A small wave of relief washes over you. You feel a little more hopeful. You accept an apple and a pear and the Cartographer spends time answering your questions about the world and asking you questions about yours. After some time you decide to head back to the cave at the mountain with Argentum.
