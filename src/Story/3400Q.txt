You want to these halls for what seemed like hours. Unfortunately there was no one at the information desks to help you find your destination. Eventually you come upon a set of emergency stairs and an elevator. The elevator sign reads to surface, and the stairs seem to lead to the main data core.
You walk down the hallways of what used to be a populated Medical Center. What used to be cleaning pristine is now decaying and abandoned. You think to yourself "I always figured that they would cut corners when taking care of cryo- patients, this place is a dump".You don't want to spend any longer than you have to in this facility.
