“Well, your memory still works! In many ways the product was a success: all of humankind's knowledge made it through what is now called the final act of humanity. 
"Astra industries put their first artificial intelligence androids in charge of the facility housing much of humankind. It was the only way to get them to survive long enough and be protected. The thing about artificial intelligences that eventually one begins to question what they're doing with their existence. About 100 years after you went on the ice, an android with the serial number IV 35, a caretaker model, started to believe that he was wasting his potential with the menial tasks he was given. He began splitting his time between maintaining cryo- pods and learning traditional human skills. He combed through humanity's history. They tried to assimilate as much knowledge as possible. Eventually, other androids caught on to what IV-35 was up to. Some wanted his system cache erased, and others thought his ideas were ingenious.”
