Hands grins. “Right to it, huh? I already have a plan, let’s go.” You follow Hands to the front door of the building, which unsurprisingly is locked. Hands then raises a fist and knocks on the door. You look around nervously. After about half a minute, the door slowly opens, revealing at least half a dozen androids waiting for you, two of which hold some advanced looking rifles with some sort of electric dart sticking out of the barrels. These androids lack more defining features and move more mechanically. One android speaks, “State your purpose.”
Hands stands a bit straighter. “We’ve come to claim what you’ve stolen. With me is one of the humans who built the first android, capable of time travel and android software manipulation.” All of the androids shift their gaze to you and Hands elbows you.
