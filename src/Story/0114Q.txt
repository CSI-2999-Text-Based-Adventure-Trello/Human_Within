What will you do?
You hid under the bushes and notice the farmer carrying his gun and searching everywhere to see if there is someone there. A few moments later he saw you and told you to get out and so you put your hands up and explain your reasons, that you have no where to go and lonely in this world. He asked why here and you responded by saying " I saw that this place would be safe because im not from here and that if they catch me im dead". So he told you to come inside and grab a dinner. You came to his house and it was covered with photos of his family, which was nice to see. He gave you breakfast to eat, and you start eating it. You later ask him?
