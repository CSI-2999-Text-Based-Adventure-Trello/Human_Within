So where would you get the disguise?
You wake up and  you explore the city and you notice how beautiful this town is. You see humans working and being watched by drones. As you are walking you see a bounty of $10,000,000 on a big screen of probably you even though it does have your face since you werenâ€™t alive at this age of time. But they have your name on the bounty since it's your name on the chain. You start to panic and start to find a way to disguise yourself to make sure to hide your identity.
