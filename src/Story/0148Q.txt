You helped him with cropping and cleaning the barn. Couple of days later, a Cyborg came to check on the status of the farm and it was shocked with how the farm looks more organized and clean. The cyborg then asked who this kid was and Mark responded by saying "He's my adopted son" and the cyborg just went with it and assigned us with a set of goals to achieve in the next 3 months and left. You guys started the tasks right away and finished a 3 month task in a month. After 3 months, the cyborg came again and asked how did you finish it so quickly?
