The old android chimes in, as have been extinct for nearly 10,000 years. That's why nobody has any amenities for humans, because there are none.
Well, to me it looks like you're trying to get food, but what need does and android have for food? Unless, you're not an android, it says with an inquisitive grin. I am a human! I don't understand why but it seems to be so baffling to every android have met! The hotel I stayed in last night had no amenities for humans, and he seemed to have me confused as some sort of representative, and/or rich android. None of this makes sense still trying to piece everything together, but I can't think straight because I'm starving!
