It must be the cryo-freeze relief android! It can explain the strange conditions of my wakening and surely the android has already paged Boston, the manager of your cryo-freezing unit. You cough out a “Hello” to the android but it shows no sign that it heard you. Several seconds pass without response. What the hell is going on? 
Your eyes open. Your body feels significantly better than earlier. You look up. Everything is dark and it takes several seconds for your vision to adjust. The first thing you notice is a silver android standing solemnly, silently in the dark, facing away from you and staring out the man-sized hole in the wall into the night.
