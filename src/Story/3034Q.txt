Rounding a corner in a hallway, and then another, your group enters a large brightly-lit room filled with several androids, two of which holding some advanced looking rifles with some sort of electric dart sticking out of the barrels. These androids lack more defining features and move more mechanically. One android speaks, “State your purpose, intruders!” You look to Hands, and he motions with his hands for you to take the lead.
Argentum quickly looks at you, and you shake your head vigorously. Better to talk things out. The android who entered the room looks about, noticing all three of you. It quickly presses a hand to its head, and an alarm begins blaring in the building. “This way!” Hands hisses and begins to exit through a different door.
