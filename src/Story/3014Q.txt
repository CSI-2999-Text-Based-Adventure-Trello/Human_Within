Argentum leads the way off the rough path into the unbroken forest. After several minutes of silence, Hands elaborates on Argentum’s super-hearing. “His auditory system was reprogrammed to a very far range. He can’t hear as well up close, and somewhere along the way his speech system got jacked up.” You ask about the poor condition of all the androids back at the cave. Hands informs you that they live apart from society and had a run of bad luck with accidents around the mountain. 
A few minutes of silence later and you begin to make out in front of you a large building similar in design to that of the earlier androids’ cave, though this building is instead built against the mountain. Hands looks to you. “We can do this quietly or we can just go in through the front. What would you prefer?”
