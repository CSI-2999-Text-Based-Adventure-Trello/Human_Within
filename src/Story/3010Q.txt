After an hour or so you start to see a light on the horizon, and the scenery starts to shift from overgrowth to a  well manicured landscape. This fills you with hope, but also annoyance. You think to yourself "it's nice to see that humanity is thriving, but the least they could do was go and help the millions of popsicles they sent down for protection." After another few hours of walking you make it to the edge of a town. 
The bluish android's countenance turns quite sad, for an android. "I see..." he says. "Then you should be on your way to the city, just north of here, the direction you came from." You nod and bid the androids farewell and quickly exit, heading north on the beaten path.
