you start to drift off to sleep
Alright sir your room has been registered to you and will be open for the next 24 hours. Feel free to ask me for assistance at any time.The door Next to the counter opens and he gestures for you to go through. You follow his orders and enter the door. Down this hall is a set of almost completely identical doors. There were no light flashing at the end of the hallway; you have no idea where to go or what room is yours. When you finally get to your room, you inspect it. It's exactly as the barkeep said it was. A room with a bed and lamp. You find it odd that there is no closet or bathroom amenities, but you're so tired that you don't care. You collapse onto the bed and push every thought from this crazy day out of your mind.
