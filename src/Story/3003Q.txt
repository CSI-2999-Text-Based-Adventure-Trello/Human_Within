You follow the silver android outside and take in the moonlit scenery around you. The scenery is nothing like you remember it. The medical center looks like a tornado chewed it up and spit it out and the surrounding landscape is wild with large, overgrown vegetation. 
The silver android walks rather swiftly on a rough path leading toward a large mountain. You follow in silence for several minutes as the green landscape rolls around you. To your left you notice a large industrial complex in ruins, then look back to the silver android walking further toward the mountain, not toward the complex. The android probably couldnâ€™t hear you if you left the path now and headed toward the broken industrial complex.
