What will you do?
You hide inside the opened locker waiting for the people to go away but as you see three people come inside the room to get their memory card, they notice something that was accidentally left from you on the table, it was a key chain that was given to you from your mother. So they were scanning your fingerprints on the necklace chain through one of his eye, to see whether the fingerprint is fresh or not. So after a couple of minutes of scanning they tell each other “T-1000 there was someone here” and your heart starts to pump and the adrenaline, they check under the table and behind the door. They leave the place by saying “ We have to exterminate the human, let's go”. After 30 min have passed, you come out wondering what you have just witnessed. You come out from the industrial complex and notice that it's dark you see of what seems to be a town . so you decided to walk, after hours you get tired so you decided to?
