You start grabbing android parts that look important. What looks like an arm  here, some nuts and bolts there… 
With your bags barely full, Argentum starts waving his hands in the air to grab your attention. He gestures in sign language to Hands, who translates quietly that there’s one android coming in our direction. You can now hear their footsteps. Argentum takes place by the door with a metal rod in his hands. Step step step. The door begins to open and Argentum raises the metal rod, poised to strike.
