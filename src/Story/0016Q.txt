The barkeep seems taken aback, but seems to understand you. He holds up one finger gesturing for you to wait and then heads to the back room. While he's gone you can't help but wonder what must've come up in the world that would've made that pattern of speech the new normal? The barkeep comes out of the back room holding what seems to be a data cartridge and hands it to you.
