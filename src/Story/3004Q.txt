The large room is well-lit, though a bit colder than outside. Sitting around a metal table on metal chairs is a group of rather human-looking androids playing cards. You count four of them, not counting the silver android. One of the androids, bluish in color with a visor for eyes, raises a particularly human-like hand with five slender fingers, pointing at you. “You’re alive!” the android speaks. Before you can reply, the android pointedly continues, “What is your occupation and year of creation?”
You keep heading toward the mountain for several more silent minutes. As you get near, you see what seems to be a large metal shack or small warehouse built into the mountainside. A neon red sign reads ‘OPEN!’ and another yellow sign reads ‘HOME’. As you approach the door, the silver android looks back at you and adjusts his face in what might be a grin before opening the door and leading you in.
