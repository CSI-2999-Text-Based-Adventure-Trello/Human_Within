To our current knowledge the last humans were taken in by a wealthy android only known as D1scret3. When they perished their bodies were donated to the IV-35 Museum of android history. I’m a cartographer… It is my purpose to persevere the history of humankind. I promise I wouldn’t lie to you.
That is the truth… there hasn’t been a human around for the last 9000 years.
