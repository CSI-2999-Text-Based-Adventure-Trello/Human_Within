What  question will you ask?
You wake up well rested. You have no idea what time it is since there is no window or clock anywhere in the room, and now that you've had some time to rest you continue to think about how peculiar it is that there is no bathroom anywhere in the suite. You head out. There's no reason for you to stay in the room and you're ready to nexplore. Before you leave you think it would be a good idea to check with the barkeep and see what resources are in this town. You walk down the same long hallway you did the previous night and emerge into the bar. The barkeep standing there to see was last night. There is no indication that he left at all.
