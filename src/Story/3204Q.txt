“The next few hundred years were full of debate on android kind should proceed, but after IV-35 managed to convince the construction and engineering drones that his ideas would lead to a more prosperous world. His ideas became more than the radical theories of a defective droid, but the undeniable truth.With the help of the construction drones he began building more androids with his ideas of change placed in their processors. With a massive amount of new and willing support, his dream soon became reality. Many of the androids who were tasked with protecting humanity soon left their posts to join this new society.Those who were left did their best to protect their creators, but with so little resources and support many of the cartographers had to abandon sections of the Astra cryo facility. Things only got worse when the power auxiliary power generator for their facility exploded killing many of the remaining cartographers and a sizable chunk of humanity. 
"What was left of humanity struggled to survive the following years of radiation poisoning. The facility was ultimately thought to be an abandoned historical site. But clearly, it is not abandoned if you are standing before me.”
