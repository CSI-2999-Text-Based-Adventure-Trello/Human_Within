The first thing you notice when you step inside are the variety of fruits hanging from trees or other plants. The second thing is the pang of hunger as you realize you haven’t eaten in at least 500 years. An android who appears to have a metallic mustache is sitting at a desk. “Good day,” he says to you rather monotonously, as Argentum leads you down a hall further into the conservatory. You enter a room with even more fruit all about. An android in the center of the room looks at you in recognition and greets you, “You’re the human that was cryofrozen. A remnant of the past! Hands just called and told me all about you.” You notice an Astra logo on his chest.
About half an hour later, you arrive at the edge of a brightly-lit city. It’s still night, but it seems like it will be dawn soon. As you follow Argentum through the city, you only see several androids, most of which moving more mechanically than those at the cave; less human-like. But no sign of any people--humans, that is. The metallic signs of life you do see watch you intently with curiosity. Following Argentum, you quickly make your way to a massive structure made mostly of glass. You stop a moment and behold its beauty, but then realize that it's the first building you’ve seen that has windows. Argentum enters through the front door and you follow.
