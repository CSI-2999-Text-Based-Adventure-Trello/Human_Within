“You said you’re from the 26th century? During the Age of Man?” quickly asks a yellow android. Looking at the yellow android you notice that it’s rather rusty and missing its right arm, with its left arm dangling by some cord and wires. You look around at all of the androids and notice they all are in pretty rough shape. Maybe you should’ve just gone to the industrial complex. The yellow android continues “We have a friend who specializes in the Age of Man.”
