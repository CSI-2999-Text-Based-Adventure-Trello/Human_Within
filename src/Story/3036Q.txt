The door fully opens and the android begins to step inside. Argentum brings down the metal rod against the android’s head and it crumples to the floor with a loud CLANG. Argentum swiftly kneels beside the fallen android to ensure they’re not conscious. A quick thumbs up confirms so. Hands whispers across the room, “That’s our cue. Let’s get out of here. Now.”
Unsure if the android on the ground is dead, and furthermore unsure about how android death works, you agree with Hands and begin to follow him out of a different door than you came in, holding your partially filled sack of parts. Down a hallway, making a left, then a right, then another right, and opening a door leads you back outside. “Let’s go,” whispers Hands.
