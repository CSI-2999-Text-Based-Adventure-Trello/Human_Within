What will you do?
You move on. No reason to see there longer than you need to, especially considering that you've been cooking in that cryo- tube for at least 500 years.You walk down the hallways of what used to be a populated Medical Center. What used to be cleaning pristine is now decaying and abandoned. You think to yourself "I always figured that they would cut corners when taking care of cryo- patients, this place is a dump".You don't want to spend any longer than you have to in this facility.You want to these halls for what seemed like hours. Unfortunately there was no one at the information desks to help you find your destination. Eventually you come upon a set of emergency stairs and an elevator. The elevator sign reads to surface, and the stairs seem to lead to the main data core.
