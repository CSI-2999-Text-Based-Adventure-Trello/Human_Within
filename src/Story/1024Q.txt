Tell me, what do you remember of the human preservation project that you are part of?
I am an Astra industries cartographer. Specifically a third generation model. Specifically, meant to keep any surviving records of humankind categorized and preserved. It's my sole purpose to know everything about the history and the downfall of the human race. If I can cry I would be sobbing right now. I never thought I would ever see a human in my existence.
