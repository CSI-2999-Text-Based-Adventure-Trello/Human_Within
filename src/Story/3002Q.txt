The silver android raises its five-fingered hands and performs some quick, complex hand gestures, several times motioning toward its mouth.  You’re no android expert, but something’s wrong with its speech system. The android points one finger at you, then at the hole in the wall, and starts to leave, obviously wanting you to follow.
You sit up and rise from the cryo-pod. “Hello?” you call out again. No response. You start to take a few steps toward the android and finally it shows some sign of life. The android turns its head and stares at you. Its eyes actually visibly move as it scans your face for a few seconds--this android model is much more advanced than any you’ve ever seen!
