How's that for a recap?
Well, Astra industries recently came out with a new body type that boasts loads of new features for a fairly inexpensive price. They're expected to have a massive demand for upgrades, and they have the new contract from the government that will be placing new mines into them as soon as next year. DH-45 was defeated by FA 1T last night securing the title and proving the worth of Method Industries new hardware. And last but not least they are still making progress on excavating the ruins of New York City. And they have found a part of the Met Art Museum.
