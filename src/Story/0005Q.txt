You wake up sometime later. The only indicator that time it passed being that the sun had disappeared beyond the horizon casting shadows upon the metal structures that surround you. Everything looks abandonedâ€¦ You look back at the chamber you stumbled out of hours before and wonder and wonder if you should stay in its shelter for one more night. Your skin is blistered, and everything hurts. You think to yourself "the state just couldn't get any worse", and then you pass out. Your eyes open. You turn your head. Your muscles ache. You look up. The sun is bright. Your vision blurs. You fall.
